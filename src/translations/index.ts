      questions: [
        {
          question: 'What should I do when I have an accident?',
          answer: 'First, stay calm. If anyone is injured, call 911 immediately. Don\'t move vehicles unless you\'re in danger and would be safer moving to another location. Get the other driver\'s name, phone number, driver\'s license, vehicle registration, and insurance information. Call your insurance company and report the accident. They\'ll ask for details, so try to get witness names and phone numbers, and note the location, time, and date. Use your camera phone to photograph the scene, vehicle damage, and witnesses.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How does the repair process work after an accident?',
          answer: 'The repair process begins when you bring your vehicle in for an estimate with a trained appraiser. We\'ll work with your insurance adjuster to process the repair claim. Our professional technicians will completely disassemble the damaged areas of your vehicle to identify any structural or mechanical damage. You\'ll be presented with a detailed repair plan, and if you agree, we\'ll order necessary parts for your vehicle and complete the repairs. After repairs are complete, we\'ll conduct a detailed interior and exterior inspection of your vehicle to ensure repair quality.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How much do repairs cost?',
          answer: 'Repair costs depend heavily on the type of damage your vehicle has sustained, the parts needed for repairs, and the processes involved. After the damage assessment is complete, you\'ll receive not only a detailed repair plan but also a quote. Your quote should include a thorough examination of the work needed on your vehicle, description of repair parts to be used, what your insurance will and won\'t cover, and the expected amount for repairs. One reason quotes may differ from other shops is the thoroughness of the assessment process. Some quotes may omit necessary repairs from the initial estimate, causing different amounts from other facilities. At D&L Auto, we\'re thorough in identifying the necessary steps for quality and safe repair of your vehicle.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How do insurance deductibles work?',
          answer: 'The at-fault party\'s insurance typically pays repair costs. If it\'s your insurance company, you may have a deductible you must pay. Your vehicle policy declaration pages will show the applicable deductible. It\'s always important to carefully check the accuracy of your policy information with your insurance company before and after a loss. Your deductible must be paid when you pick up your vehicle after repairs are complete. Look for a shop that offers financing for deductibles if you don\'t want to pay this upfront.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What types of vehicles do we work on?',
          answer: 'D&L Auto is equipped to work on all makes and models. We have relationships with every parts supplier in the country, meaning if a part is available, we can order it. We take pride in sourcing the best available auto parts to restore your vehicle to pre-accident condition.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What makes our auto repair shop stand out?',
          answer: 'Customer service. D&L Auto is undeniably the best in customer service. Our attention to detail, quality control, and customer safety are unmatched. We strive to answer every phone call during business hours, we inspect all vehicles before returning them to customers, and we stand behind our work. There\'s a reason we\'re considered one of the best auto repair shops in Boston.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What types of parts do we use?',
          answer: 'D&L Auto uses various types of parts (OEM, aftermarket, or used parts). This is determined by each insurance company\'s requirements as well as customer requests. We discuss with customers, on a case-by-case basis, what the insurance company has determined we should use and then, with guidance from our Appraiser, decide what\'s best for a specific vehicle.'

        {
          question: 'Tôi nên làm gì khi gặp tai nạn?',
          answer: 'Trước tiên, hãy bình tĩnh. Nếu có người bị thương, gọi 911 ngay lập tức. Không di chuyển xe trừ khi bạn đang gặp nguy hiểm và sẽ an toàn hơn nếu di chuyển xe đến vị trí khác. Bạn nên lấy tên của người lái xe khác liên quan cùng với số điện thoại, giấy phép lái xe, giấy tờ xe và thông tin bảo hiểm của họ. Gọi cho công ty bảo hiểm và thông báo về tai nạn. Họ sẽ hỏi chi tiết, vì vậy hãy cố gắng lấy tên và số điện thoại của nhân chứng và cũng ghi chú vị trí, thời gian và ngày tháng. Sử dụng điện thoại camera để chụp ảnh hiện trường, hư hỏng xe và nhân chứng.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Quy trình sửa chữa xe sau tai nạn hoạt động như thế nào?',
          answer: 'Quy trình sửa chữa bắt đầu với việc bạn mang xe đến để nhận báo giá với chuyên viên đánh giá được đào tạo. Chúng tôi sẽ làm việc với đại lý bảo hiểm của bạn để xử lý yêu cầu bồi thường sửa chữa. Các kỹ thuật viên chuyên nghiệp của chúng tôi sẽ tiến hành tháo rời toàn bộ các khu vực bị hư hỏng của xe để xác định bất kỳ hư hỏng cấu trúc hoặc cơ khí nào. Bạn sẽ được trình bày một kế hoạch sửa chữa chi tiết và nếu bạn đồng ý, chúng tôi sẽ đặt hàng các bộ phận cần thiết cho xe của bạn và sau đó hoàn thành việc sửa chữa. Sau khi sửa chữa hoàn tất, chúng tôi sẽ tiến hành kiểm tra chi tiết bên trong và bên ngoài xe của bạn để đảm bảo chất lượng sửa chữa.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Chi phí sửa chữa là bao nhiêu?',
          answer: 'Chi phí sửa chữa phụ thuộc rất nhiều vào loại hư hỏng xe của bạn gặp phải, các bộ phận cần thiết để sửa chữa và các quy trình liên quan. Sau khi đánh giá hư hỏng hoàn tất, bạn sẽ được cung cấp không chỉ một kế hoạch sửa chữa chi tiết mà còn một báo giá. Báo giá của bạn nên bao gồm một cuộc kiểm tra kỹ lưỡng về công việc cần thực hiện trên xe của bạn, mô tả về các bộ phận sửa chữa sẽ được sử dụng, những mục bảo hiểm của bạn sẽ và sẽ không bao gồm và số tiền dự kiến cho việc sửa chữa. Một trong những lý do báo giá có thể khác với xưởng khác là tính kỹ lưỡng của quy trình đánh giá. Một số báo giá có thể bỏ qua các sửa chữa cần thiết khỏi báo giá ban đầu, gây ra số tiền khác với cơ sở khác. Tại D&L Auto, chúng tôi kỹ lưỡng trong việc xác định các bước cần thiết để sửa chữa chất lượng và an toàn cho xe của bạn.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Khoản khấu trừ bảo hiểm hoạt động như thế nào?',
          answer: 'Bảo hiểm của bên có lỗi thường chi trả chi phí sửa chữa. Nếu đó là công ty bảo hiểm của bạn, thì bạn có thể có khoản khấu trừ mà bạn phải chi trả. Các trang tuyên bố chính sách xe của bạn sẽ cho biết khoản khấu trừ áp dụng. Luôn quan trọng là kiểm tra kỹ tính chính xác của thông tin chính sách của bạn với công ty bảo hiểm trước và sau khi có tổn thất. Khoản khấu trừ của bạn phải trả khi bạn nhận xe sau khi sửa chữa hoàn tất. Tìm xưởng sửa xe cung cấp tài chính cho khoản khấu trừ nếu bạn không muốn trả tiền này.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Chúng tôi làm việc với loại xe nào?',
          answer: 'D&L Auto được trang bị để làm việc trên tất cả các nhãn hiệu và mẫu mã. Chúng tôi có quan hệ với mọi nhà cung cấp phụ tùng trong cả nước, có nghĩa là nếu bộ phận có sẵn, chúng tôi có thể đặt hàng. Chúng tôi tự hào về việc tìm nguồn cung cấp các bộ phận ô tô tốt nhất có sẵn để khôi phục xe của bạn về tình trạng trước tai nạn.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Điều gì làm cho xưởng sửa chữa ô tô của chúng tôi vượt trội?',
          answer: 'Dịch vụ khách hàng. D&L Auto không thể phủ nhận là tốt nhất về dịch vụ khách hàng. Sự chú ý đến chi tiết, kiểm soát chất lượng và an toàn khách hàng của chúng tôi là không thể sánh kịp. Chúng tôi cố gắng hết sức để trả lời mọi cuộc gọi điện thoại trong giờ mở cửa, chúng tôi kiểm tra tất cả các xe trước khi trả lại cho khách hàng và chúng tôi đứng sau công việc của mình.

Điều này được xác định bởi yêu cầu của từng công ty bảo hiểm cũng như yêu cầu của khách hàng.

      questions: [
        {
          question: '¿Qué debo hacer cuando tengo un accidente?',
          answer: 'Primero, mantenga la calma. Si alguien está herido, llame al 911 inmediatamente. No mueva los vehículos a menos que esté en peligro y sea más seguro moverse a otra ubicación. Obtenga el nombre, número de teléfono, licencia de conducir, registro del vehículo e información del seguro del otro conductor. Llame a su compañía de seguros e informe el accidente. Le pedirán detalles, así que intente obtener nombres y números de teléfono de testigos y anote la ubicación, hora y fecha. Use la cámara de su teléfono para fotografiar la escena, daños del vehículo y testigos.'
        },
        {
          question: '¿Cómo funciona el proceso de reparación después de un accidente?',
          answer: 'El proceso de reparación comienza cuando trae su vehículo para una estimación con un tasador capacitado. Trabajaremos con su ajustador de seguros para procesar la reclamación de reparación. Nuestros técnicos profesionales desmontarán completamente las áreas dañadas de su vehículo para identificar cualquier daño estructural o mecánico. Se le presentará un plan de reparación detallado, y si está de acuerdo, ordenaremos las piezas necesarias para su vehículo y completaremos las reparaciones. Después de que se completen las reparaciones, realizaremos una inspección detallada interior y exterior de su vehículo para garantizar la calidad de la reparación.'
        },
        {
          question: '¿Cuánto cuestan las reparaciones?',
          answer: 'Los costos de reparación dependen en gran medida del tipo de daño que ha sufrido su vehículo, las piezas necesarias para las reparaciones y los procesos involucrados. Después de que se complete la evaluación del daño, recibirá no solo un plan de reparación detallado sino también un presupuesto. Su presupuesto debe incluir un examen exhaustivo del trabajo necesario en su vehículo, descripción de las piezas de reparación a usar, qué cubrirá y no cubrirá su seguro, y la cantidad esperada para las reparaciones. Una razón por la que los presupuestos pueden diferir de otros talleres es la minuciosidad del proceso de evaluación. Algunos presupuestos pueden omitir reparaciones necesarias de la estimación inicial, causando cantidades diferentes de otras instalaciones. En D&L Auto, somos minuciosos en identificar los pasos necesarios para una reparación de calidad y segura de su vehículo.'
        },
        {
          question: '¿Cómo funcionan los deducibles del seguro?',
          answer: 'El seguro de la parte culpable típicamente paga los costos de reparación. Si es su compañía de seguros, puede tener un deducible que debe pagar. Las páginas de declaración de póliza de su vehículo mostrarán el deducible aplicable. Siempre es importante verificar cuidadosamente la precisión de la información de su póliza con su compañía de seguros antes y después de una pérdida. Su deducible debe pagarse cuando recoja su vehículo después de que se completen las reparaciones. Busque un taller que ofrezca financiamiento para deducibles si no desea pagar esto por adelantado.'
        },
        {
          question: '¿En qué tipos de vehículos trabajamos?',
          answer: 'D&L Auto está equipado para trabajar en todas las marcas y modelos. Tenemos relaciones con todos los proveedores de piezas del país, lo que significa que si una pieza está disponible, podemos pedirla.

Esto está determinado por los requisitos de cada compañía de seguros así como las solicitudes de los clientes. Discutimos con los clientes, caso por caso, sobre lo que la compañía de seguros ha determinado que debemos usar y luego, con orientación de nuestro Tasador, decidimos qué es mejor para un vehículo específico.'
